# Celsus

<div style="text-align: justify">
Welcome to the beautiful world of Celsus Library. Our goal is to make your tasks easier.
But which tasks are we talking about? It is a good question that you may have.
Here, at the Celsus Library, we are, as the name may let you guess it, dealing with textual corpora.
With the use of OpenAI and langchain, we managed to create an AI helper that can assist you with the following tasks:
</div>

- Create books summaries
- Extract quotes related to keywords
- Create a bibliography related to genres and/or keywords
- Obtain the main "theme" of a text

<div style="text-align: justify">
One might ask: "Why those options and not something else?"

To simplify our answer, Celsus is here to help you identify basic elements on a book/document, such as summaries, in order to guide you through your classes/research. It can also act as a tool for text extraction to get relevant quotes.

Now let's talk about the different points above in more detail; such as how they work, or in which ways you can use those options.

Summaries are generated thanks to the use of OpenAI and langchain. With this tool, you will get generated book summaries in no time. This can help you if you have to work on a specific part of a book/document without having to look at it entirety, but still need to know more about the main themes (in case of a fiction in example here).

If you are part of the academic field, in particular, quotes are vital for you. Celsus allows you to download the extracted quotes based on your queries, so you can keep them saved for your personal uses.

Much like the summaries, the key-words option allows you to get the main themes of a book. It will show as keywords that would summarise your document in a few words.

In all of this, we almost forgot to present you the team, generously working to make your time better:
Formed by four veterans of the intellectual's war of 2022, coming from the university of Lausanne, they organised together to survive the overflow of needs. 
Leaded by the glorious BlackRaven204, accompanied by the high mental coefficient Roz, the divine alcoholic DÃ©esse and the mind's razor Olipper, they went into a long crusade together against the miss-organisation of the IT world.
