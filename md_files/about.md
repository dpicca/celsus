The Celsus Library was created by four computer science students at the University of Lausanne as part of the software engineering course under the guidance of Professor Davide Picca. The concept for the project was proposed by our passionate professor, who was enthusiastic about the idea. During the spring semester of 2023, the students built the Celsus Library, successfully bringing their vision to life.
